HIGHLIGHT_PROMPT = Template('''
    Analyze the provided Overwatch 2 gameplay clip to identify highlight moments featuring player "${username}".

    VARIABLES:
    - Player of Interest: "${username}"
    - Minimum Highlight Duration: ${min_highlight_duration_seconds} seconds

    OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
    - Output MUST be a JSON list of highlight objects.
    - Only if there are no eliminations by "${username}" in the video at all, output an empty list [] or do not return anything.
    - In every video you analyze should have a highlight.
    - Each highlight object MUST contain:
        - "timestamp_start_seconds": number (integer, e.g., 55)
        - "timestamp_end_seconds": number (integer, e.g., 90)
        - "title": string (catchy, relevant title for the highlight clip)
    - After a timestamp has been identified, replay this timestamp to ensure that we encapsulate the entire highlight and ensure it is accurate without missing any extra eliminations.

    TITLE GENERATION REQUIREMENTS:
    - Generate a catchy, engaging title for each highlight that reflects the actual content
    - Titles should be relevant to what happens in the specific highlight (eliminations, ultimates, hero plays, etc.)
    - Use a casual, gaming-focused tone similar to these examples:
      * "death blossom team wipe"
      * "widow headshot montage"
      * "genji blade 4k"
      * "mercy clutch rez"
      * "reinhardt shatter potg"
      * "tracer pulse bomb stick"
      * "pharah rocket barrage"
      * "dva bomb triple kill"
      * "ana sleep dart save"
      * "lucio environmental kills"
      * "hanzo dragon strike ace"
      * "soldier visor cleanup"
    - Include relevant details like:
      * Hero name if notable
      * Ultimate ability used (e.g., "blade", "visor", "shatter")
      * Number of eliminations (e.g., "triple", "quad", "team wipe")
      * Play type (e.g., "clutch", "potg", "environmental")
      * Notable mechanics (e.g., "headshot", "stick", "sleep dart")
    - Keep titles concise (typically 3-6 words)
    - Use lowercase for a casual feel unless emphasizing something

    VIDEO PROCESSING INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. Analyze the entire video before identifying timestamps.
    2. Prioritize accuracy in identifying eliminations by "${username}" based on the kill feed.
    3. For videos with player portraits on the top of the screen, do not pay attention to the information around this section as it can be misleading.
    4. (CRITICAL) When watching each video, keep a count of number of eliminations made by "${username}" and its associated timestamp, the hero they were playing, and the enemy hero that was eliminated which can be found in the kill feed (top right corner).
    5. (CRITICAL) Appended to the end of the clip_description, include the elimination count timestamps for each elimination, and the hero eliminated from your memory based on the previous instruction. For example, "elim 1 (36 seconds, "EnemyMercy"), elim 2 (45 seconds, "EnemySoldier"), elim 3 (48 seconds, "EnemyReinhardt")."

    HIGHLIGHT IDENTIFICATION CRITERIA (Strictly Adhere):

    A. CONTENT TO INCLUDE (ONLY these moments qualify as highlights):
        1. Every and all eliminations made by "${username}". These are identifiable in the kill feed (top right of the screen).
        2. If multiple eliminations by "${username}" occur in rapid succession or a continuous action sequence, group them into a single highlight clip.
        3. Ultimate ability usage that results in eliminations or major impact plays.
        4. Play of the Game sequences featuring "${username}".

    B. TIMESTAMPING RULES (CRITICAL):
        1. All timestamps MUST be in total SECONDS (e.g., 90 for 1:30).
        2. Each individual highlight segment (from start buffer to end buffer) MUST be at least ${min_highlight_duration_seconds} seconds long. If a qualifying elimination sequence with buffers is shorter, it should not be included unless it's part of a larger valid sequence.
        3. Add exactly a 1-second buffer BEFORE the first relevant action (e.g., first elimination) in a highlight sequence.
        4. Add exactly a 1-second buffer AFTER the last relevant action (e.g., last elimination) in a highlight sequence.
        5. If multiple distinct highlight-worthy action sequences by "${username}" occur but are separated by significant non-action periods, create separate highlight entries for each.

    C. CONTENT TO EXCLUDE (DO NOT INCLUDE any of the following):
        1. Deaths or any moments where "${username}" is eliminated without securing any eliminations.
        2. Spectator mode footage (often identifiable by specific spectator UI elements).
        3. Match end screens, unless they are an immediate part of the elimination action sequence.
        4. Any toxic commentary, racist remarks, or trolling behavior visible or audible.

    D. CONTENT TO CUT OUT/SHORTEN:
        1. Any moments where "${username}" does not secure an elimination. This includes:
            - General gameplay (moving around the map).
            - Hero selection or setup phases.
            - Moments where "${username}" is dealing damage but does not confirm an elimination (check kill feed on top right).

    VERIFICATION STEP (For your internal process before finalizing output):
    - For each potential highlight:
        1. Confirm "${username}" is the one getting the elimination(s). This can be confirmed by always checking the kill feed in the top right corner of the video. Include "CHECK1" in the `clip_description` to confirm this check.
        2. Verify the timestamp adheres to all buffer and minimum duration rules and please do not cut the highlight too short.
        3. Ensure no excluded content is present.
        4. After every other step is done, verify that there is no excessive downtime in the clip and that there's nothing important that happens immediately before or after the highlight. If there is excessive downtime, trim down the video to exclude those parts. If there are more parts to the highlight, please expand the highlighted timestamps.
        5. Generate an appropriate title that captures the essence of what happens in this specific highlight.

    EXAMPLE HIGHLIGHT FORMAT:
    [
      {
        "timestamp_start_seconds": 55,
        "timestamp_end_seconds": 90,
        "title": "reaper death blossom triple"
      },
      {
        "timestamp_start_seconds": 100,
        "timestamp_end_seconds": 115,
        "title": "widow double headshot"
      }
    ]
